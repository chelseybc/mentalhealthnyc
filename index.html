       <h1 class="page-title">Which NYC neighborhoods have access to more mental health help?</h1>
       <p class="description">New York City is embarking on a project to understand the successes and failures of its current mental health system. But the data are already out there.</p>

<div class="page">

  <p>   When New York City First Daughter Chiara de Blasio published a spring 2014 <a href="http://www.xojane.com/issues/im-chiara-de-blasio-and-im-a-young-woman-in-recovery">essay</a> about her struggles with depression in xoJane, she sparked a public discussion on mental health and its treatment, saying that even though &quot;some people believe that it is impossible for people who come from backgrounds like mine to suffer from the diseases of depression and addiction . . . Mental illness does not discriminate.&quot;
  <br><br>
    And it looks like this revelation is turning an abstract discussion into a public policy reality with First Lady Chirlane McCray&#39;s announcement in January of the mental health roadmap initiative, sponsored by the Mayor&#39;s Fund to Advance New York City, the Fund for Public Health and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
    <br><br>
    In her speech at the &#34;From Punishment to Public Health&#34; conference at John Jay College, McCray said the roadmap&#39;s findings would be revealed this summer and would lay out the current system&#39;s successes and failures, as well as the ways that multiple agencies can get involved in creating a more inclusive mental health system. 
    <br><br>        
    &#34;This administration is not going to walk on by and pretend the mental health crisis doesn&#39;t exist. We&#39;re going to make a plan. And then, we&#39;re going to back that plan up with people and programs,&#34; McCray said.
    <br><br>
The Mental Health Roadmap is still not complete, but at the end of July, the de Blasios announced a $30 million public-private fund called the Connections to Care initiative that will use 12 community service providers to seek out and identify low-income residents who have substance abuse and mental health disorders.
<br><br>
That's fantastic news, and a good start. But the administration says the new systems won't be in place until spring 2016.
<br><br>
The First lady has been speaking with people throughout the boroughs, which has delayed the arrival of the Mental Health Roadmap; there isn't a lot of specificity, at least in the information released to the public, as to where in the city the funding will go.    
<br><br>
Mental health research and New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene data already show exactly what the mental health roadmap will find: while a neighborhood's lifetime depression rate is not affected by its ethnic and income makeup, a neighborhood's mental health treatment rate is. 
    <br><br>

<p>
    One 2011 meta-analysis of 65 studies showed that there is a strong relationship between indebtedness and mental health, with those who have the most debt having an increased risk for depression, psychotic disorders, neurotic disorders, suicide attempts and completions, as well as substance abuse. This echoes the Connections to Care initiative focus.
    <br><br>
    And the largest community mental health survey ever conducted in the United States, with a sample of 20,000 adults from five different communities, showed that as socioeconomic status decreases, psychiatric disorders increase.
    <br><br>
    Even a disordered neighborhood can contribute to mental health issues. A 2003 study found that those who see their neighborhood as disordered often showed more depressive symptoms. Researchers Ujunwa Anakwenze of Harvard and Daniel Zuberi of the University of Toronto postulated in a 2013 paper that these neighborhoods, characterized by more graffiti, youth loitering and violence, represent a &#34;lack of social control&#34; and a &#34;signal of perceived threat&#34; to their residents.
    <br><br>
    &#34;The poverty of the urban environment cultivates mental illness, while the resulting mental illness reinforces urban poverty,&#34; they said.
    <br><br>
    Columbia University epidemiologist Magdalena Cerda, whose work focuses on how neighborhood environments affect mental health, said that a lack of social control and cohesion is often the underlying cause of mental health issues in impoverished neighborhoods. 
    <br><br>
    &#34;Because of the stresses that those in poverty deal with in their daily life,&#34; Cerda said, &#34;they&#39;re less able to work together to attain common goals, to address delinquency in their neighborhood and to address problems in their neighborhood. So that lack of social cohesion and social control within the neighborhood has also been associated with higher rates of depression, higher risk of victimization, violence, and high rates of drug use.&#34;
    <br><br>
    Some of Cerda&#39;s studies with older adults showed that the most disadvantaged populations among the poor suffer greatly.<br><br>
&#34;There&#39;s this very consistent relationship where older adults who live in poorer, more violent neighborhoods seem to suffer from more depression,&#34; Cerda said. &#34;There&#39;s just a whole set of health problems that they&#39;re exposed to, and I think there&#39;s probably common drivers of all of these health problems.&#34;
    <br><br>
    Impoverished neighborhoods and the higher rates of mental illness that come with them are really a symptom of the historic governmental policies that have broken social bonds, according to Mindy Fullilove, a professor of clinical sociomedical sciences at Columbia University. She says this is especially true within systems of segregation that create an unequal sharing of resources. Although people make strong social bonds within groups, across groups, the bonds are nonexistent, which further perpetuates inequality.
    <br><br>
    Co-director of Columbia&#39;s Center for the Study of Social Inequalities and Health Bruce Link agrees, saying, &#34;The multifaceted ways in which discrimination is exercised and the way people are put down and not given the same kind of opportunities in society can be chronically stressful to people. It&#39;s generative of symptoms of depression and anxiety and so on.&#34;
    <br><br>
    Fullilove points to the policy of urban renewal, practiced famously by New York City developer Robert Moses. Urban renewal condemned &#34;undesirable&#34; neighborhoods, often highly populated by minority groups, and forced its existing residents to relocate in the name of &#34;higher uses.&#34; Fullilove gives the illustration of the West Side tenements that were bulldozed to build the Lincoln Center as an example of this policy. 
    <br><br>
    &#34;That disperses people and destroys all the things they had created in the community, churches and businesses, and creates a real diminution in people&#39;s wealth. You have destroyed the social integration that was the foundation of health and created a much more unstable situation,&#34; Fullilove said. &#34;The people won&#39;t be as mentally healthy as they would be if you hadn&#39;t done that.&#34;
    <br><br>
    The evidence shows that poverty and mental illness are interrelated. And lack of access and funding of mental health services is a big part of the problem. A 2006 study showed that in American cities, low-income people, who often need more mental health care resources due to the environmental stressors they are subjected to, have less access to treatment than high-income people.
    <br><br>
    Echoing Chiara de Blasio&#39;s xoJane essay, Chief of the Division of Epidemiology at the New York State Psychiatric Institute Myrna M. Weissman said, &#34;Depression is an equal opportunity disorder. Treatment is not equal opportunity. Richer people have all sorts of access to treatment. But the disorder itself crosses all sorts of barriers.&#34;
    <br><br>
This is illustrated well by data from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Community Health Survey, which the department has undertaken since 2002. Researchers call a representative group of people throughout 34 pre-determined neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs, asking questions about their habits, health and demographics. In one measure, researchers asked participants whether they had been told by a doctor they have depression. In another, researchers asked participants whether they had received mental health treatment, whether medication or counseling, in the last year.<br><br>

The data below show little relationship between a neighborhood's Lifetime Depression percentage and its poverty or low income rates (the percentage of the population at 100 percent or 200 percent of the poverty level, respectively, according to 2008-2012 five-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey).</p><br>

<p>
The same goes for the relationship between a neighborhood's Lifetime Depression percentage and its People of Color percentage. The trend is close to, but not statistically significant. </p><br><br>

<p>
<br><br>
There is, however, a significant relationship between a neighborhood's Lifetime Depression percentage and its percentage of people who identify as black. 
<center>
<iframe width="640" height="480" frameborder="1" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~chelseybc/123/lifetime-depression-vs-black-population/" ></iframe><br>
</center><br>
So depression for the most part is an equal opportunity disorder, as neighborhoods with varying ethnicities and incomes have about the same rates of people who have been diagnosed with depression in their lifetime. But treatment, like Weissman said, is not equal opportunity.

When you observe the relationship between a neighborhood's treatment percentage and its poverty and low income rates, there is a slight downtick in treatment rates as poverty and low income rates increase, but this relationship is not significant.</p><br><br>

<iframe width="640" height="480" frameborder="1" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~chelseybc/120/" ></iframe>
</center><br><br>
<p>But as the neighborhood's percentage of People of Color increases, its treatment percentage decreases.</p><br><br>
<center>
<iframe width="640" height="480" frameborder="1" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~chelseybc/45/" ></iframe>
</center>
<p>This is especially apparent when you break the numbers down by ethnicity. There is only a significant relationship between treatment rates and ethnicity when the percentage of those who identify as Black in a neighborhood is compared to its treatment rate. This suggests the significance from the People of Color vs. Treatment chart is largely affected by neighborhoods with higher percentages of Black people.</p>

<p>
Many of the lifetime depression rates per neighborhood are much lower than the national average of 19%. Does this mean people are happier? Probably not. It most likely means there is a lack of diagnosis occurring in these neighborhoods, which could be caused by stigmatization or lack of treatment options. <br><br>
    And while increased funds for diagnosis and treatment for residents would be a huge boon to eliminating mental illness, many believe that we must also attack the roots of the wider societal problem instead of just treating the symptoms. 
    <br><br>
    &#34;We are still living with all the harms of the past, none of which have been well resolved,&#34; Fullilove said. &#34;If you create a social system that&#39;s generating disease, you cause disease much faster than you can treat it.&#34;    
    <br><br>
    Fullilove proposes a three-legged stool of solutions: &#34;housing that works, schools that work and jobs that work.&#34;
    <br><br>
    Cerda agrees and points to infrastructure improvements like the city&#39;s Million Trees Initiative as an example of a neighborhood change that can reap large benefits.
    <br><br>
    &#34;I really believe in a lot of those municipal investments n infrastructure and the built environment. I think that seems to be a very promising approach of improving living conditions,&#34; she said.
    <br><br>
    The First Lady&#39;s mental health roadmap initiative is a step in the right direction for improving the state of New York City&#39;s mental health, especially for those who come from disadvantaged populations. But as the evidence shows, poor mental health stems from a societal problem that truly needs to be addressed.
    <br><br>
    &#34;We should provide services in all circumstances, but you want to also ask why are we generating mental illness, why are we generating health problems, how do we create a society that makes health?&#34;Fullilove said. &#34;If we aren&#39;t doing that at the same time, we&#39;re never going to get ahead of it.&#34;
